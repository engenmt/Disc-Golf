The growing sport of disc golf is a variation on traditional (ball) golf, but with players attempting to throw flying discs at a target instead of attempting to hit a ball into a hole. The Professional Disc Golf Assocation (PDGA) approves discs for professional play and maintains a registry of a few physical characteristics of registered discs. The image below, taken from the PDGA technical standards document, shows the cross section of a disc with a number of measurements marked, several of which are registered with the PDGA.

The variation in disc shapes leads to different flight characteristics. Some discs fly faster than others, some have more glide, etc. Many disc manufacturers do their best to summmarize these flight characteristics with four "flight numbers"â€”speed, glide, turn, and fade. This short project aims to use polynomial regression on the PDGA-registered measurements to predict the flight numbers of Innova-brand discs.

# The data

The PDGA makes their database of physical characteristics available for download, which we named `pdga.csv`. The flight numbers assigned to identical discs vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, so we chose to only analyze discs from one manufactuerer. Innova has the most PDGA-approved discs among all manufacturers, and many in the sport look to model their flight numbers after Innova's, so they were the natural choice to analyze. 

Innova has 157 PDGA-approved discs, which we can import from `pdga.csv`:

The flight numbers of Innova discs weren't as easily available as the physical characteristics. We obtained many (106) of them off the [Innova website](https://www.innovadiscs.com/disc-golf-discs/disc-comparison/) and were able to find 21 more through internet searches. These flight numbers are maintained in `innova.csv`.
